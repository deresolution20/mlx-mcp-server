> MCP server bridging Claude to local MLX LM (and any OpenAI-compatible backend)

## Overview

This repository is part of my professional portfolio. It is written primarily in **Python** and maintained with professional standards: documented, licensed, and (where applicable) tested and CI'd.

## Features

- **Offload-first, token-thrift** — routes eligible work (summarize, extract, classify, boilerplate, single-file review, first drafts) to a free, private local model before spending paid Claude tokens.
- **Self-correcting `iterate` ladder** — retries locally, then a bigger local model, then escalates to Claude; free rungs are exhausted before any paid work.
- **Gated retries** — structural gates (`require_json` / `schema_keys` / `contains` / `regex` / `min_len`) and an executable gate (run a linter or test against `$CANDIDATE_FILE`) let the local model fix its own output.
- **Runtime model switching** — swap the active model by name or fuzzy fragment with no Claude restart; choice persists across restarts.
- **Work-hours guard** — optionally blocks large (>22 GB RAM) models during work hours to avoid swap thrashing.
- **One-step install** — wires the MCP server and slash commands (`/switch-model`, `/mlx-help`) into Claude Code or Claude Desktop.
- **Backend-agnostic** — works with MLX LM or any OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint; content-free usage metrics, MIT licensed, tested and CI'd.

## Getting Started

Requires Python 3.11+ and a running OpenAI-compatible LLM backend (MLX LM on Apple Silicon is recommended).

```bash
pip install mlx-mcp-server
mlx-mcp-server install --claude-code --with-commands   # wire into Claude Code, then restart Claude
```

See [Usage](#usage) for backend setup, configuration, and the full tool reference.

## Usage

### 1. Start a local LLM backend

The server talks to any OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint. On Apple Silicon, [MLX LM](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm) is recommended:

```bash
pip install mlx-lm
mlx_lm.server --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct-4bit   # serves on http://localhost:8080
```

Any other OpenAI-compatible backend works too (e.g. Ollama on Linux/Intel — point `MLX_BASE_URL` at `http://localhost:11434`).

### 2. Install and wire it into Claude

```bash
pip install mlx-mcp-server

# One-step setup for Claude Code (also installs the /switch-model + /mlx-help slash commands)
mlx-mcp-server install --claude-code --with-commands

# ...or Claude Desktop
mlx-mcp-server install --with-commands

# Preview the config without writing anything
mlx-mcp-server install --claude-code --dry-run
```

The installer writes an `mlx` entry into your Claude config (`~/.claude/settings.json` for Claude Code, or the Claude Desktop config). **Restart Claude afterward** to load the server. Verify the backend is reachable with the `health_check` tool, or run `mlx-mcp-server help` for the full CLI reference.

### 3. How Claude uses it — offload-first

The whole point is **token thrift**: Claude routes eligible work (summarize, extract, classify, reformat, boilerplate, single-file review, simple refactors, first drafts) to your free, private local model before spending paid tokens. The headline tool is `iterate`, which runs a self-correcting escalation ladder:

> **local model retries** (feeding each gate failure back in) → **a bigger local model** → **escalate to Claude**

Free rungs are exhausted before any paid work happens. You attach a **gate** so the local model can self-correct:

- **Structural gates** (cheap, content-free): `require_json`, `schema_keys`, `contains`, `regex`, `min_len`
- **Executable gate**: `check_command` — a shell command that sees the candidate at `$CANDIDATE_FILE` and exits `0` to pass (e.g. a linter or test)

With no gate, `iterate` runs a single local attempt and asks Claude to verify.

```text
# Generate boilerplate, gated by a linter — retries locally until ruff is happy
iterate(message="write a Python slugify() function",
        category="boilerplate",
        check_command="ruff check $CANDIDATE_FILE")

# Extract structured data, gated on valid JSON with required keys
iterate(message="extract name, email, company from this signature: ...",
        category="extract",
        require_json=true,
        schema_keys=["name", "email", "company"])

# Quick one-off to the local model, no iteration
chat(message="explain what this regex does: ^\\d{3}-\\d{4}$")
```

### Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `iterate` | Offload a task with a gate; retries locally, then a bigger local model, then escalates to Claude |
| `chat` | Send a single prompt to the local model and get the response + token usage |
| `quick_test` | Run a canned diagnostic (`hello` / `math` / `creative` / `code_review`) to sanity-check the model |
| `list_models` | List loaded models with speed/quality descriptions and the active marker |
| `set_model` | Switch the active model at runtime by name or fuzzy fragment — no restart needed |
| `health_check` | Confirm the backend is reachable |
| `set_work_hours_guard` | Block large (>22 GB RAM) models Mon–Fri 8am–5pm MT to avoid swap thrashing |
| `get_config` | Show current config (URL, active model, guard state) — resource `config://settings` |

Inside Claude Code, the bundled slash commands give you `/switch-model` (interactive model picker) and `/mlx-help` (this reference).

### Configuration

Set as env vars in the MCP server entry (the installer scaffolds these):

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `MLX_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Backend `/v1` URL |
| `MLX_DEFAULT_MODEL` | _(empty)_ | Optional — auto-detected from `/v1/models` if unset |
| `MLX_API_KEY` | _(empty)_ | Optional, for secured backends |
| `MLX_TIMEOUT` | `30` | Request timeout in seconds |

## Development

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # if present
# Run tests
pytest -q
```
